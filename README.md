Linear Models for Predicting the Female Education Rate in Asian Country
To create a linear model that can give future projections of the population of the four
major Educations in Asia for the year 2030, 2050 and 2070.
To compare the prediction for the four Countries' Female Education Growth with one
another.
To compare our prediction of the worldâ€™s largest Education after 50 years with that of
Pew Research Center
To conduct a systematic review of the available data from international
organizations and regional registries to explore the association between female
education and fertility choices in South Asia.
Using linear regression with the least-squares method, we will be able to predict which of
these Educations will be or will remain the largest Education by population in the future.
